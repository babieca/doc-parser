MARKET INSIGHTS

The investment outlook for 2018
A difficult place to start  investing in 2018 and beyond

IN BRIEF
 The levels of key economic variables look very good. The more
troubling question centers on rates of growth from here.
 As monetary policy is normalized around the developed world,
yields should move gradually higher, pointing to the need for
flexibility in fixed income investing.
 Equity market performance in the coming year should hinge on
three variables: earnings, inflation and interest rates. Earnings are
a function of economic growth, and we expect that the healthy
pace of economic growth seen in the second half of 2017 can
continue into next year.

 We expect global economic momentum to continue in 2018,
which, combined with still low levels of inflation in the developed
world and a gradual normalization of monetary policy, is a
positive backdrop for international equities to continue
outperforming those in the U.S. in the year ahead.
 Heading into 2018, it is important to remember some time-tested
principles for successful long-term investing: cash isnt always
king, diversification is essential, harness the power of
compounding and dont let volatility derail you.

A DIFFICULT PLACE TO START  INVESTING IN 2018 AND BEYOND

A DIFFICULT STARTING POINT
Many years ago, I remember seeing a TV commercial
promoting a well-known brand of Irish beer. A man with a thick
Spanish accent walks into a pub and asks the assembled
Dubliners if they could please tell him the way to Ail-ez-bury
Road (which local viewers would have recognized as the
location of the Spanish embassy).
Now Irish people will always offer directions, whether they
know the way or not, because it is just friendly to offer advice,
and so a variety of unlikely routes are loudly suggested to the
tourist. One suggests that he start by heading north up
OConnell Street. Another proposes that he commence his
journey by heading west along the canal. After a cacophony of
confusion, a wiser punter gives him a brimming pint of beer
and says: To tell you the truth, I wouldnt start from here.
And so he settles into the pub for the night.
Entering 2018, most American investors should feel richly
rewarded by a long economic expansion and extended bull
markets in equities and bonds. However, looking forward, they
should also recognize that this is not a great starting point and
that the very length and strength of the bull markets to this
point will limit returns going forward. This makes choosing
portfolio overweights and underweights even more important
and makes it critical that investors control their enthusiasm for
the most expensive assets.
Economic growth could pick up in the short run

T H E IN V ES T MEN T O UTL O O K F O R 2 018

As seen in Exhibit 1, the U.S. economic expansion, which has
provided just 2.2% growth per year since its inception in 2009,
appeared to pick up its pace in the middle of 2017 as falling
unemployment boosted both consumer and business
confidence. Real GDP grew by roughly 3% annualized in both
the second and third quarters of 2017 and may be rising at a
similar pace in the fourth quarter, as repairing, restoring and
replacing after a tough hurricane season have added to
Our base case scenario is that this above-trend pace of growth
will continue into the first half of 2018 as lower income tax
withholding and corporate tax cuts promote increased
consumer and investment spending. However, it should be
noted that an extended delay in passing a tax act might be
more harmful than having no tax reform at all, since
uncertainty about the nature of tax cuts could cause companies
to delay investments until they receive more clarity.
More importantly, either way, economic growth will likely slow
down to a 2% or slower pace later in 2018 and beyond. The
reason for this can be found in the jobs market.
As this is being written, the U.S. unemployment rate has
fallen from a peak of 10.0% in October 2009 to 4.1% today
(Exhibit 2, next page). However, this decline in the
unemployment rate has been accelerated by very slow 0.5%
annual growth in the labor force. This, in turn, largely reflects a
wave of workers retiring, a trend that started in earnest in
2012 as the first baby boomers turned 65. An Indian summer
of economic growth in 2017 and early 2018 may well push the
unemployment rate down to 3.5% by late next year. However,
it is unlikely to go much lower than that given the everyday
friction and churning that occurs in the jobs market. At that
point, and barring a surge in immigration, the U.S. economy
will have to get by with roughly 0.5% annual employment
growth per year. Moreover, a lack of investment spending in
recent years has meant that output per worker has grown by
just 0.9% per year over the past decade (Exhibit 3, next page).

believe that a slower expansion with slightly higher inflation

the longest expansion in U.S. history.

The profit picture, in late 2017, also looks good, with S&P 500
operating earnings posting a nearly 10% year-over-year gain
for the third quarter. It should be noted that this strong yearover-year gain is largely being driven by a revival in energy
company profits and a year-over-year decline in the dollar,
which has boosted overseas revenues. Earnings should
continue to look strong in the first half of 2018 but then, like
economic growth itself, earnings could come under pressure
from low top-line revenue growth and the higher interest rates
and wage costs that could accompany an economy operating at
the peak of its capacity.
It should also be recognized that the corporate tax cut
currently being debated by Congress would help boost
earnings going forward. As this is being written, the final form
of such a bill is very much in doubt. However, we know that, to
gain passage in the Senate, the total tax cuts for both
households and businesses cannot exceed $1.5 trillion over 10
years, or an average of $150 billion per year. If we assume that
S&P 500 companies get $60 billion of this, the tax cut would
amount to roughly 5% of projected S&P 500 company profits
for the next 12 months. Even this is probably an overestimate
of the net benefit to corporate profits since the tax cut would
be financed through deficit spending and so would have to be
paid for by either higher taxes or lower government spending
in some future years. In addition, the higher interest rates and
wage costs that fiscal stimulus might generate could also eat
into profits. Corporate profit growth, like economic growth,
could fall back later in 2018 following a few quarters of
excellent gains.
One of the great puzzles of the economic expansion throughout
the developed world has been the low level of consumer
inflation. In a highly competitive global economy, both wages
and consumer prices have not responded to continuous
infusions of central bank liquidity. In general, we expect this
pattern to continue in the year ahead with the Feds preferred
inflation measure, the personal consumption deflator, only
rising from 1.6% year-over-year growth in October 2017 to
about 2.0% year-over-year by the end of 2018. However, we
believe that excess liquidity could continue to push a wide
range of asset prices higher, boosting consumer wealth but
also raising the specter of asset bubbles.

A DIFFICULT PLACE TO START  INVESTING IN 2018 AND BEYOND

The global economy should maintain strong growth into 2018.
Europe has seen solid improvement over the past year, despite
tensions from Brexit and in Catalonia and, with 8.9%
unemployment, clearly still has plenty of capacity for abovetrend growth. Japan has also had a good year and a lower yen
could help maintain economic momentum even though
inflation is slow to respond to very low unemployment. China
will emphasize the quality of growth rather than its pace in the
years ahead but there seems little reason to fear an abrupt
slowdown. And other emerging markets should continue to
improve following the commodity slump of 2015/2016, with a
reform agenda in many countries holding out hope for more
stable growth going forward. Importantly, although global
central banks will generally be tightening in 2018, these are
the very early days of a tightening cycle when economic effects
of increases in interest rates tend to be mildest for developed
countries and emerging markets alike.
For the Federal Reserve, the economy of 2018 should provide
ample justification for further tightening (Exhibit 4). Very low
unemployment, slowly rising inflation, faster-rising asset
prices, a weaker dollar, strong overseas growth and domestic
fiscal stimulus all suggest that monetary policy remains too
loose. The Fed has already laid out a clear plan for the
reduction of its balance sheet and, barring a recession, we
expect this plan to be implemented. In addition, presuming
Jerome Powell is confirmed as Fed chair, he may be more
likely to follow the balance of opinion on the FOMC with regard
to tightening, a consensus that may be more hawkish than in
2017, given a turnover in personnel at the Fed.

All of this presents an interesting economic backdrop for
investors. In the ninth year of economic expansion, the
economy is in a good place with regard to the levels: high
economic activity, low unemployment, high levels of profits
and low levels of inflation and interest rates. However, the
direction of change in many of these variables looks less
positive, particularly later in 2018 and 2019, even if the
economy avoids shocks. This is why, in 2018, a more thoughtful
approach to investment strategy is essential.

FIXED INCOME: PREPARING FOR MONETARY POLICY
NORMALIZATION
2017 has been characterized by strong growth around the
world. A faster-moving economy is no doubt a good thing for
investors portfolios, helping to boost earnings, lift sentiment
and move risk assets higher. However, faster economic growth
also presents a challenge to global central bankers and fixed
income investors.
In many ways the global economy has been like a sick patient
in a hospital. Upon admission, doctors, in the form of central
bankers, have pumped the patient full of monetary policy
medicine. With the patient now looking healthier, the doctors
must change their approach and wean the patient off of the
medicine. As anyone who has given up sugar or coffee will
know, breaking an addiction doesnt come without its side
effects. With central banks hiking interest rates, reducing asset
purchase programs and shrinking balance sheets, there will be
some negative withdrawal effects around the world over the
next 12 months, particularly in fixed income markets.
However, central bankers are not going to make financial
markets go cold turkey by withdrawing monetary policy
stimulus all at once. Assuming inflation remains relatively
subdued, it is likely to be a long and gradual journey back
toward a more normal approach to monetary policy. Exhibit 5
on the next page shows the number of rate hikes and rate cuts
done by the top-10 developed market (DM) central banks since
2008. Notably, in 2017, none of the major DM central banks cut
rates for the first time since the global financial crisis; instead,
they have seven hikes among them, with an additional
potential hike from the Federal Reserve in December 2017.
Beyond interest rate hikes, asset purchase programs by two
major central banks  the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
Bank of Japan (BoJ)  are also set to slow in 2018.

2017 has seen a number of central banks raise rates, a

As the rest of the world begins to normalize policy in 2018, the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will already be well along its way,
having been the first mover in both interest rate hikes and
balance sheet reduction. We believe the Fed will continue to be
relatively aggressive, raising interest rates three times in 2018
beyond the likely hike in December 2017. The Feds balance
sheet reduction program, kick-started in late 2017, will likely
ramp up over the course of the next 12 months, which should see
the balance sheet contract by about $400bn by the end of 2018.
As monetary policy is normalized around the developed world,
bond prices should fall and yields should move gradually higher.
As we enter this unprecedented period of monetary policy
normalization, it is important to ask: how should fixed income
investors be positioning their portfolios? First, U.S. investors
should expect a little less from their core fixed income
holdings. Since 1990, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. aggregate
index has yielded, on average, 5.0%, with an annual return of
6.2%. Over the next year, this historical performance is unlikely
to be repeated. Investors should look to clip the coupon and
brace for some small negative movements in bond prices.
With a tepid return outlook for core U.S. holdings, it will
become even more tempting for investors to search for
additional yield outside of their traditional fixed income
holdings while simultaneously diversifying. However, it is
important to be selective in this search. With the global
economic backdrop looking robust, areas such as emerging
market debt look particularly attractive, while in the U.S.,
sectors with atypical responses to rising interest rates, like
high yield and emerging market debt, could play a part in
helping to lift returns. That said, broad fixed income

diversification runs the risk of coming with increased
correlation to S&P 500 returns. This increased correlation, in
turn, has the potential to make a portfolio less diversified from
a risk perspective. Therefore, maintaining an exposure to core
fixed income remains a critical part of an investment portfolio.
In summary, the reduction in monetary policy stimulus is likely
to lead to some withdrawal effects for fixed income investors
over the next year. Central banks are likely to continue raising
rates, reducing asset purchase programs and shrinking balance
sheets, albeit gradually. Such steps are likely to drive down
bond prices and hamper the returns on fixed income holdings
in 2018. However, investors should not completely despair;
with the help of areas such as high yield and emerging market
debt, returns from fixed income holdings are likely to be
positive, just lower than history.

U.S. EQUITIES: BACK TO SCHOOL
For equity investors, the turn of each calendar year is much
like a students first day at a new school. They are excited by
the prospect of a fresh environment, which they know will be
full of new questions and unforeseen challenges, but
simultaneously a bit nervous as they are forced to leave a
world in which they had become comfortable.
At the beginning of 2017, investors were plagued by
uncertainty. How many times would the Fed hike interest rates,
and how would that impact markets? What would the first year
of a new administration in the White House bring? Would the
underperformance of growth stocks ever come to an end? How
much longer would corporate profits remain under pressure?
Profits look set to continue rising next year

A DIFFICULT PLACE TO START  INVESTING IN 2018 AND BEYOND

While we now have answers to many of these questions,
investors have found themselves faced with a new laundry list
of issues for the coming year. In 2017, economic growth
surprised to the upside. Will this better-than-expected growth
continue? Will a corporate tax cut get passed? What are the
market implications of a shift in both monetary and fiscal
policy? How far can rates rise before they begin to weigh on
equity market performance?
Equity market performance in the coming year should hinge on
three variables: earnings, inflation and interest rates. Earnings
are a function of economic growth, and we expect that the
healthy pace of economic growth seen in the second half of
2017 can continue into next year. However, potential growth
for the U.S. economy remains around 2%, suggesting that the
above-trend pace we have seen should begin to moderate in
the second half of 2018.
That said, even a moderate pace of underlying growth, coupled
with a slight acceleration in the pace of inflation, could lead to
stronger-than-expected revenue growth and potentially offset
any downward pressure on margins stemming from a rise in
wages. Over time, stock prices follow earnings, and given our
expectation that the economy will avoid recession in the
coming 12 months, profit growth should continue, providing
fundamental support for equity markets to push higher
(Exhibit 6, previous page). Any fiscal stimulus in the form of a
corporate tax cut will be the icing on the cake.

There is the potential that above-trend growth, coupled with
fiscal stimulus, could lead inflation to pick up more than
expected. While there is still room for inflation to accelerate
before it comes in conflict with the Feds 2% target, any
meaningful acceleration in inflation could lead market-based
expectations of interest rates to re-price, potentially
undermining the low interest rate and low volatility
environment that has underpinned the melt-up in multiples
seen over the past year.
However, with earnings continuing to grow, we expect that any
volatility on the back of a repricing in interest rate expectations
should remain relatively contained. Yes, it could lead to the
elusive 10% correction investors have been searching for, but
with equities still cheap relative to fixed income and the
fundamentals looking solid, the risk of a bear market in the
immediate future seems a bit remote. The question then
becomes: at what level will rising rates begin to weigh on
equity markets? As shown in Exhibit 7 below, historically the
10-year U.S. Treasury yield has been able to rise to a level of
5% before interest rates and equity markets become negatively
correlated.

Rising rates should not be a headwind for equities, yet

The problem is that a backdrop of steadily falling rates over
the past 35 years, coupled with central bank policy that has
kept yields at artificially low levels during this business cycle,
suggests the threshold for a shift in correlations may be lower
than it has been historically. While the exact level is subject to
debate, a qualitative analysis of why rates are rising can tell us
what we need to know. If rates are rising for all of the right
reasons  namely better economic growth, more normal
monetary policy or healthier rates of inflation  equities should
continue to move higher. However, if rates begin rising for the
wrong reasons  the economy is overheating, the Fed is trying
to cool things off or inflation is getting a bit too hot  equities,
and equity multiples, will likely begin to come under pressure.
Given a backdrop of moderate economic growth, decent
earnings growth, minimal inflation and gradually rising interest
rates (from low levels), U.S. equities should be capable of
generating mid-to-high single digit returns next year. The risk
to this view stems from the fact that the U.S. is late cycle; with
the unemployment rate expected to fall further, higher
inflation and a more hawkish Fed seem inevitable.
Furthermore, as we consider the investment options available
in the coming year, economies outside the U.S. are far earlier
in their respective business cycles, and still experiencing
double-digit profit growth. Thus, with the first day of school
just around the corner, investors would be wise to choose a
curriculum that allows them to study abroad.

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES IN 2018: STILL CLIMBING
At one time or another, we have all sat next to a nervous flier
on a plane. They are easy to spot: the enhanced alertness to
any announcement over the loud speaker, the preoccupied
focus on the planes course on the map and sometimes even
the outstretched hand when turbulence surfaces. Oftentimes,
that behavior is the result of a prior bad experience on a flight,
so the concern is understandable. I have actually been that
person myself. Over time, I realized that I cannot let a previous
situation hold me back from reaching my destination or
prevent me from enjoying the ride, especially when I trust
the pilot.

After four years of international equity underperformance
relative to U.S. equities, with many worries along the way, it
makes sense that some investors are scared to board the flight
again or to relax during the journey. However, after over a year
of strong, synchronized global economic and earnings growth,
investors should recognize that the scariest part of the flight is
behind us. We are now past 10,000 feet, the moment when the
pilot allows the flight attendants to walk around, turns the wi-fi
on and tells everyone to enjoy the ride. After a tepid
acceleration in global growth in mid-2016, the global economy
picked up speed over the course of 2017 with all of the major
regions participating in the recovery. As we write this piece,
96% of major economies have a PMI figure above 50, indicating
acceleration. This has created a virtuous cycle of consumption,
earnings growth and investment around the world. We expect
this momentum to continue in 2018, which, combined with still
low levels of inflation in the developed world and a gradual
normalization of monetary policy from major central banks, is a
positive backdrop for international equities to continue
outperforming those in the U.S. in the year ahead (Exhibit 8).
2018 should be another year of strong global economic growth
and, crucially, another year of strong earnings growth as well.
Profits in several regions around the world grew at a doubledigit pace in 2017; however, investors should remember that
there is still plenty of room for them to keep climbing. While
U.S. companies have been reporting record-high earnings since
2011, emerging market earnings would have to grow by 10% to
reach their previous peak, and eurozone earnings would have
to grow by 59% to reach theirs. With the encouraging
acceleration in economic growth continuing, we can expect
these gaps to continue to close.
After years of U.S. earnings outpacing international,
a reversal is beginning

Overall, international valuations are now at average levels after
18 months of rallying markets (Exhibit 9). The plane is no
longer at the beginning of the climb, but at these levels, and
especially compared to U.S. valuations, it is tough to conclude
that we are at the end of the ascent.

While it continues to look like a favorable time for international
equities, investors should make sure they have the right pilot.
Crucially, one who is able to identify the best routes, whether
by region or by sector. We continue to favor emerging markets

Lastly, we expect the U.S. dollar to continue acting as a
tailwind to international returns for U.S. investors. We believe
we are still at the beginning stages of a long move down for
the dollar, as a result of better global growth, narrowing
interest rate differentials, more stable commodity prices and a
persistent U.S. current account deficit. This weaker dollar
environment should continue to provide a boost to
international returns in the year ahead.
2018 does have the potential for some pockets of turbulence,
whether they arise from the continued geopolitical tensions in
the Middle East and North Korea or from the several elections
occurring around the world, such as in Italy and in a multitude
of Latin American countries. However, one of the important
lessons from 2017 is that investors should not let event risks
such as elections restrain them from considering overseas
opportunities. Oftentimes, the strong underlying economic
momentum wins out. As a result, investors should not
overreact to turbulence in the year ahead, and instead pay
more attention to the destination.

Lets compare two very different timekeeping devices: namely
a broken clock and a sundial. While hot, flashy investing tactics
and behaviors may work for short periods of time or when in
favor,  just as the time frozen on the broken clocks face is
correct twice a day, investors should focus on tried and true
principles of investing: behaviors that build success in a
portfolio with greater consistency, like the way a sundial tells
time. While being a simple device, a sundial can consistently
and easily  barring very cloudy weather  tell you the time
with great accuracy.
The following four investing principles are timeless and their
importance holds regardless of what the growth rate of the U.S
economy is, who the Fed chair is or whatever might be going
on in China  and that is what makes them indispensable.
First and foremost, cash has and will continue to be a poor
long-term investment. Even with rates continuing to normalize
in 2018, interest rates and therefore the return on cash will not
increase enough to make the overall cash return attractive.
When we factor in inflation, we continue to get a negative real
return on cash (Exhibit 10A, next page) as has been the case
in every year since 2009. While cash has a small place in a
portfolio, we know there are enormous amounts of cash sitting
on the sidelines, almost $110,000 on a per household basis 
well above total home mortgage debt (Exhibit 10B, next page).

Cash earns a negative real return and yet households keep

If cash is moved off of the sidelines, where should it go? A
second principle is diversification. Being diversified has been
key for investors, and that will continue to be the case in 2018.
While in any one year a diversified portfolio is never the best
or the worst performer when we look across returns of nine
asset classes (Exhibit 11, next page), its benefit truly shows
over the long run. Over the last 15 years, a hypothetical
diversified portfolio had an average annual return of almost
7%, with a volatility of 11%  an attractive risk/return profile.
The last 15 years have been filled with all sorts of events 
wars, market crashes and natural disasters  namely, the type
of events that would make you want to bunker down in cash
and gold  and that would have been disastrous for returns.
Often diversification gets a bad wrap for not working, 
especially when one part of the market is roaring ahead,
leaving a diversified portfolio to lag behind, but overall, and
over time, diversification works and is a winning strategy for
long-run investors.
Diversification will be especially important in fixed income,
where a rising rate environment will mean that navigating the
asset class in an active way will be essential. Holding good
quality fixed income as the umbrella for when a storm hits and
traversing the gambit of sub-sectors in the market in a flexible
and nimble way for returns will be key.
Being diversified and increasingly selective in equities will also
be crucial. With returns in the longer term being limited by our
starting point in 2018, choosing sectors, factors and regions
will be critical for higher returns.

Income: Barclays US Aggregate, REITs: NAREIT Equity REIT Index. The Asset Allocation portfolio assumes the following weights: 25% in the S&P 500, 10% in the Russell
2000, 15% in the MSCI EAFE, 5% in the MSCI EME, 25% in the Barclays US Aggregate, 5% in the Barclays 1-3m Treasury, 5% in the Barclays Global High Yield Index, 5% in the
Bloomberg Commodity Index and 5% in the NAREIT Equity REIT Index. Balanced portfolio assumes annual rebalancing. Annualized (Ann.) return and volatility (Vol.) represent
period of 12/31/01  12/31/16. All data represent total return for stated period. Past performance is not indicative of future returns.

All that said, why not wait for a large correction to create a
buying opportunity? Because even in the later stages of the
cycle there exist opportunities: international markets are still
climbing, while in the U.S earnings growth can support another
year of the bull run. But an even more compelling reason to be
in the market relates to our third principle: compounding.
The only way to have the power of compounding on your side
is to be invested. Its worth noting that while compounding is a
long-run phenomenon  supporting the adage Its about time
in the market, not market timing  compounding starts
working immediately, benefiting the investor over shorter time
horizons as well. The combination of opportunities in the
market and the math that compounding starts working
immediately provide persuasive reasons as to why investors
should not wait for a correction to invest.

Our last principle concerns volatility, and the value of knowing
that volatility is normal. While we do not know what events
may occur in 2018, the tide of volatility that has been out for
the last few years very well may come in. Government policy,
Fed action and events abroad all have the ability to spook the
market in different ways. Investors should not let volatility
derail their asset allocation or time invested in the market.
While sundials are not the fanciest way to tell the time and do
not work in every single instance, they have served a great
purpose, working consistently for countless people all over the
world since 700 B.C. The investing principles presented are not
as old and distinguished as the sundial, yet they have been a
critical component of successful investing throughout modern
financial history. And they will continue to be important as
investors navigate the challenges of an old expansion and
extended bull markets in 2018.
