Iran and North Korea;

North Korean internal stability could come into question as economic sanctions begin
to bite;

Political risks in the U.K. and Italy could rise with markets overly complacent on both;

Emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Mexico, will see renewed political risk.

uoyant global growth, political stability in Europe, and steady policymakers hands
in China have fueled risk assets in 2017. As the year draws to a close, investors also
have tax cuts in the U.S. to celebrate.

Our high conviction view that tax cuts would happen  and that they would be fiscally
profligate  is near the finish line.1 In making this call, we ignored the failure to repeal
Obamacare, the wisdom of old D.C. hands, and direct intelligence from a source inside
the White House circle who swore tax reform would be revenue neutral. Throughout the
year, BCAs Geopolitical Strategy remained confident that the GOP would ignore its fiscal
conservative credentials and focus on the midterm elections.2 That election is increasingly
looking like a bloodbath-in-the-making for the Republican Party (Chart 1).

What of the latest opinion polls showing that the tax cuts are unpopular with half of all Americans?
The polls also show that a solid one-third of all Americans remain in support of the Republican
plan (Chart 2). We suspect  as do Republican strategists  that those are the Republicans who
vote in midterm elections. Given the atrociously low turnout in midterm elections  just 36.4% of
Americans voted in 2014  Republicans need their base to turn out in November. The tax cuts are
not about the wider American public but the Republican base.
As we close the book on 2017, we look with trepidation towards 2018. Our main theme for next
year is that the combination of economic stimulus from the tax cuts in the U.S. and structural
reforms in China will create a U.S.-dollar-bullish policy mix that will combine into a headwind for
global risk assets, particularly emerging market equities.3 However, in this report, we focus on some
of the more exotic risks that investors may have to deal with.
In particular we focus on five potential black swans  low probability, high market-impact events
 that are neither on the markets radar nor the medias.

To qualify for our list, the events must be:

Unlikely: There must be less than a 20% probability that the event will occur in the next 12

Out of sight: The scenario we present should not be receiving media coverage, at least not as
a serious market risk.

Geopolitical: We must be able to identify the risk scenario through the lens of our geopolitical
methodology. Genuinely unpredictable events  such as meteor strikes, pandemics, crippling
cyber-attacks, solar flares, alien invasions, and failures in the computer program running the
simulation that we call the universe  do not make the cut.

Black Swan 1: Lame Duck Trump
Lame duck presidents  leaders whose popularity late in their term has sunk so low that they can
no longer affect policy  are said to be particularly adventurous in the foreign arena. While this adage has a spotty empirical record, there are several notable examples in recent memory.4 American
presidents have few constitutional constraints when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, when
domestic constraints rise, U.S. presidents seek relevance abroad.
President Trump may become the earliest, and lamest, lame duck president in recent U.S. history.
While his Republican support remains healthy, his overall popularity is well below the average presidential approval rating at this point in the political cycle (Chart 3). Based on these poll numbers, his
party is likely to underperform in the upcoming midterm election (Chart 4). A Democrat-led House
of Representatives would have the votes to begin impeachment, which we would then consider likely
in 2019. As we have argued in our impeachment handbook, the market impact of such a crisis
would ultimately depend on market fundamentals and the global context, not political intrigue.5
President Trumps political capital ahead of the midterm elections is based on his ability to influence Republican legislators. Despite low overall poll numbers, President Trump can use the threat
of endorsing primary challengers against conservative peers in Congress to move his agenda in the
legislature. He has effectively done this with tax cuts. However, the day after the midterm elections,
President Trumps own numbers will matter for the GOP. Given that President Trump will be on the
ballot in the 2020 general election, his low approval numbers with non-Republican voters will hang

President Clinton launched the largest NATO military operation against Yugoslavia amidst impeachment proceedings against him
while President George H. W. Bush ordered U.S. troops to Somalia a month after losing the 1992 election. Ironically, President
George H. W. Bush intervened in Somalia in order to lock in the supposedly isolationist Bill Clinton, who had defeated him three
weeks earlier, into an internationalist foreign policy. President George W. Bush ordered the surge of troops into Iraq in 2007 after
losing both houses of Congress in 2006; President Obama arranged the Iranian nuclear deal after losing the Senate (and hence
Congress) to the Republicans in 2014.

like an albatross around the partys neck. This
is a serious issue, particularly given that 22 of
the 33 Senators up for reelection in 2020 will
be Republican.6
Robust economic growth and a roaring stock
market have not boosted Trumps popularity
so far. At the same time, a strong economy
ready to translate into higher wages is about
to be pump-primed by stimulative tax cuts
(Chart 5). We would expect the result to be a
stronger dollar, which should keep the U.S.
trade deficit widening well into Trumps second year in office. At some point, this will
become a sore political point, given Trumps
protectionist rhetoric and his administrations
focus on the trade balance as a key measure
of U.S. power.
What kind of adventures would we expect to see
President Trump embark on in 2018? There are
three prime candidates:

China-U.S. trade war: The Trump administration started off with threats against
China and then proceeded to negotiations.
However, neither the North Korean situation
nor the trade deficit has seen substantial
improvement, and a lame duck Trump administration would be more likely to resort
to serious punitive actions. Even improvements on the Korean peninsula would
not necessarily prevent Washington from
getting tougher on Beijing over trade, as
the Trump administration will be driven by
domestic politics. Investors should carefully

could trigger a U.S. backlash, and whether the various investigations by U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross result in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed more frequently on specific Chinese exports. Thus far, the empirical
evidence suggests that the Trump administration has picked up the pace of protectionist rulings
(Chart 6). Notably, the Trump administration claims that the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue
has stalled, and it is reviving deeper, structural demands on Chinese policymakers.7

Iran Jingoism: Rumors that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may be replaced by CIA Director
Mike Pompeo  who would be replaced at the CIA by Senator Tom Cotton  can only mean one
thing: the White House has Iran in its sights. Both Pompeo and Cotton are hawks on Iran. The
administration may be preparing to shift its focus from North Korea, where American allies in
the region are urging caution, to the Middle East, where American allies in the region are urging
aggression. Investors should watch whether Tillerson is removed and especially how Congress
reacts to President Trumps decision on October 15 to decertify the Iran nuclear agreement (also
called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA). The Republican-controlled Congress
has until December 15 to reimpose sanctions on Iran that were suspended as part of the deal,
with merely a simple majority needed in both chambers. However, President Trump will also
have an opportunity, as early as January, to end waivers on a slew of sanctions that were not
covered under the JCPOA.

U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David Malpass recently claimed that high-level talks had stalled and
re-emphasized the U.S.s structural complaints: We are concerned that Chinas economic liberalization seems to have slowed
or reversed, with the role of the state increasing  State-owned enterprises have not faced hard budget constraints and Chinas
industrial policy has become more and more problematic for foreign firms. Huge export credits are flowing in non-economic ways
that distort markets. The growing presence of Communist Party cells within corporations is another important structural concern
that puts the administration at loggerheads with Chinas leaders. Please see Andrew Mayeda and Saleha Mohsin, US Rebukes

North Korea: It would be natural to slot
North Korea as first on our list of potential
foreign policy adventures for President
Trump. However, it does not really fit our
qualification of a black swan. North Korea
is not out of sight. Additionally, President
Trump has already broken with the tradition
of previous administrations by upping the
pressure on Pyongyang. In fact, a North
Korean black swan would be if President
Trump succeeded in breaking the regime in
Pyongyang. To that scenario we turn next.

President Trump is an astute political analyst
and will sense these developments before they
happen. There is a good chance that he will
attempt to sway the election and pre-empt his lame duck status with an aggressive foreign policy.
Investment implications are twofold. First, we continue to recommend an equally weighted basket
of Swiss 10-year bonds and gold as a portfolio hedge.9 Second, risk premium for oil prices should
rise in 2018. Not only is the supply-demand balance favorable for oil prices, but geopolitical risks
are likely to rise as well.

Black Swan 2: A Coup In Pyongyang
Our colleague Peter Berezin, BCAs Chief Global Strategist, has suggested that a coup dtat against
Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un could be a black swan trigger that spooks the markets.10 While Peter
used the scenario as a tongue-in-cheek way to weave Kim into a narrative that tells of a late 2019
recession, we have long raised North Korean domestic politics as the true Korean black swan.11
Here we entertain Peters idea for three reasons.12
First, China has upped the economic pressure on Pyongyang. Under Kim Jong-un, the North Korean state has attempted some limited economic opening up, namely to China. But the attempt
to finalize the nuclear deterrent has delayed an already precarious process. There has now been a
$617 million drop in Chinese imports from the country since the beginning of the year (Chart 8),
with coal imports particularly affected (Chart 9). China has also pulled back on tourism. Meanwhile,
North Koreas imports of Chinese goods have risen, which suggests that the countrys current account balance may be widening. At some point, if these trends continue, Pyongyang will run out of
foreign currency with which to purchase Chinese and Russian imports.

stories of plots and conspiracies against the regime.

Pyongyang
could miscalculate and
create a crisis
from which
it cannot
deescalate.

Second, Pyongyang is well aware of pressures against the regime. The assassination of Kim Jongnam  the older half-brother of Kim Jong-un  in February of this year sent a message to the world,
but especially to China, which kept Kim Jong-nam around as an alternative to the current Kim.
That Pyongyang went to the extreme lengths of poisoning Kim Jong-nam with VX nerve agent in
a foreign airport suggests that Kim Jong-un is still worried about threats to his rule.13 If Beijings
economic sanctions continue to tighten in 2018, the military could conceivably see the Supreme
Leaders aggressive foreign policy as a risk to regime survival.
Third, Pyongyang could miscalculate and create a crisis from which it cannot deescalate. A provocation that disrupts international infrastructure and commerce or kills civilians from the U.S. or
Japan could trigger a downward spiral. For instance, an attack against international shipping in
the Yellow Sea or Sea of Japan by North Korean submarines would be an unprecedented act that
the U.S. and Japan would likely retaliate against.14 We could see the U.S. following the script from
Operation Praying Mantis in the Persian Gulf in 1988  the largest surface engagement by the U.S.
Navy since the Second World War. In that incident, the U.S. sunk half of Irans navy in retaliation
for the mining of the guided missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts. In the case of North Korea,
this would primarily mean taking out its approximately 20 Romeo-class submarines and an unknown
number of domestically-produced  Yugoslav-designed  newly built submarines.
Such a conflict is not our baseline case, but we assign much higher probability to it than an all-out
war on the Korean Peninsula. How would Pyongyang react to the sinking of its submarines?
Our best case is that the regime would do nothing. The leadership in Pyongyang is massively
constrained by its quantifiable military inferiority. True, North Korea has around 6 million military
personnel  about 25% of the total population is under arms  but unfortunately for Pyongyang,
this large army is arrayed against one of the most sophisticated defenses ever constructed by man:
the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). To support its ground forces, North Korea would have at its disposal
only about 20-30 Mig-29s. Countering two dozen jets would be South Koreas combined 177 F-15s
and F-16s, plus American forces that would vary in size depending on how many aircraft carriers
were deployed in the vicinity. Given that a single American aircraft carrier holds up to 48 fighter
jets, North Koreans would quickly find themselves fighting a losing battle.
Which is why they may never initiate one. If Kim Jong-un insists on retaliation, the military could
remove and replace him with, for instance, his 30-year old sister, who has recently risen in party
ranks, or his 36-year old brother Kim Jong-chul, who is apparently not entirely uninvolved in the
regime despite living an unassuming life in Pyongyang.

Still worried, that is, even after Kim Jong-uns supposed consolidation of power in 2013-14 when he executed his influential
and China-aligned uncle, Jang Song Thaek, and purged the latters faction. There were reports of rogue military operations at that
time. With low troop morale reported by North Korean defectors, the possibility of insubordination cannot be ruled out.
A North Korean submarine sank the South Korean corvette Cheonan in 2010, and North Korean artillery shelled two islands killing
South Korean civilians later that year, but these attacks were still within the norm of North Korean provocations. The two countries
are still technically at war and have contested maritime as well as land borders.

Latest polls
suggest that
Bremorse
has set in.

What would a regime change mean for the markets? It depends on whether it is successful or not.
An unsuccessful coup could lead to a massive purge and likely a total break in Pyongyangs relations
with the outside world, including China. This would seriously destabilize North Koreas decisionmaking. The global community would have to begin contemplating a total war on the Korean peninsula. Alternatively, a successful coup could lead to temporary volatility, yet long-term stability.
The military regime in the North may even be open to reunification over the long term, depending
on how U.S.-China relations evolve.
Bottom Line: China does not want to cripple North Korea or throw a coup. But it is cooperating with
sanctions and could therefore trigger one by mistake. At least two regimes have collapsed in the past
when facing the pincer movement of economic sanctions and American military pressure  South
Africas apartheid regime in 1991 and Slobodan Miloevics Yugoslavia in 1999. Kim Jong-un could
face a similar fate, particularly if China applies excessive economic pressure.

U.K.s three kingdoms before it even has the chance to collapse over differences with the EU.15

The market may cheer a Labour-Scottish National Party (SNP) coalition government, a potential
winner of an early election, as it would mean that a new referendum on the U.K. leaving the EU
could be held. The latest polls suggest that Bremorse (remorse for Brexit) has set in, as a clear
majority in the U.K. thinks that Brexit was a bad idea (Chart 12). However, we suspect that it
would take Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn several months, if not over a year, before he called such
a referendum. First, Corbyn is on record supporting a soft Brexit, not a new referendum, and he has
only just begun to adjust this position. Second, a soft Brexit is far more difficult to achieve than the
hard Brexit of Prime Minister Theresa May since it requires the U.K. to subvert its sovereignty in
significant ways (i.e., accepting EU regulation) in order to access the EU Common Market. Third,
the most politically palatable way to re-do the referendum is to put a U.K.-EU deal up to the people
to decide, which means that Corbyn first has to spend a long time negotiating that deal.
The market may be disappointed to find out that PM Corbyn is not willing or able to put the question
of the U.K.s EU exit up to a vote right away. Instead, the market would have to deal with Corbyns
economic policies, which are markedly left-wing. Corbyn harkens back to the 110 Propositions pour
la France of French President Franois Mitterrand, if not exactly to the ghastly 1970s of the U.K.s
own history. A brief sample platter of Labours proposals under Corbyn includes:

Increasing the U.K. corporate tax rate to

Nationalizing public infrastructure companies.

How should investors play a Corbyn victory? We
think that the U.K. pound would likely rally on a
higher probability of reversing Brexit. However,
this no Brexit rally would quickly dissipate
as PM Corbyn reiterated his promise to fulfill
the democratic desire of the population to exit
the EU. While Corbyns negotiating team set
to work on getting a better Brexit deal out of
Brussels, the market would quickly turn its attention to the reality that Corbyn is not kidding

its fair value (Chart 13). However, as BCAs chief FX strategist Mathieu Savary points out, the valuation technicals may be misleading as the currency has entered a new economic, trade, and political
paradigm. A Corbyn premiership is not clearly positive for Brexit, while opening up a completely
different question: is the U.K. also exiting the free-market, laissez-faire paradigm that it has helped
lead since May 1979?

Black Swan 4: Italy Is A Black Swan Hiding In Plain Sight
The spread between Italian and German 10-year government bonds has narrowed 72 basis points
since April, suggesting that investors have grown comfortable with the risks associated with the
Italian election due by May (Chart 14). There are three reasons why we agree with the market:

New electoral rules passed in October make it highly likely that a center-right alliance will
take shape between the Forza Italia of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and the mildly
Eurosketpic Lega Nord. These two could form a government alone, or in a grand coalition with
the center-left Democratic Party (PD) (Chart 15).

To help investors get ready for a Corbyn premiership, we thought his appearance on President Nicols Maduros weekly radio show
would be a good place to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eL8_wtS-0I

Both Lega Nord and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) have moved to the center
on the questions of European integration and membership in the currency union;

The European migration crisis is over and its supposedly constant impact on Italy is waning
(Chart 16). Meanwhile, Italys economy is on the mend, with its banking sector finally following
the Spanish trajectory with a drop in non-performing loans (Chart 17).

That said, we continue to warn clients that the underlying support for the common currency is
lagging in Italy. The support level is just above 55%, despite a strong rally in the rest of the Euro
Area (Chart 18). Similarly, over 40% of Italians appear confident in the countrys future outside of
the EU (Chart 19).
Our baseline case is that Italian elections will produce a weak and ineffective government, though
crucially not a Euroskeptic one. How could we be wrong?
Easy: one of the three reasons why we agree with the market could shift. For example, M5S could
alter its pledge to remain in the Euro Area and surprisingly win on a Euroskeptic platform. Why
would the party do something like that? Because it makes sense!

Polls are already showing that M5Ss recent moderation on the euro is not paying political dividends,
with its support sharply sliding since the summer. With power quickly slipping out of reach for the
party, why wouldnt they put a down-payment on the next election by trusting the underlying trend
in opinion polling and investing in a Euroskeptic platform that might pay political dividends in
the future? If we think that this strategy makes sense based on the data, then the M5S leadership
might as well.
Another scenario is a major terror attack perpetrated by recent migrants from North Africa. Italy
has been spared from radical Islamic terror. As such, the country may not be as desensitized to it
as other European nations. A strong showing by Lega Nord and the far-right Fratelli dItalia could
force Forza Italia to move to the right as well.
On our travels, we have noticed that few investors want to talk about Italy. There is wide acknowledgement of the structural trends pointing to a rise of Euroskepticism in the country, but also an
appearance of consensus that this is a problem for a later date. We agree with this consensus, but
our conviction is low.
Bottom Line: Italian election risk is completely unappreciated by the markets. The countrys equity
market is one of the best performing this year (Chart 20), while government bonds are pricing in
no political risk as the election approaches. We believe that shorting both would present a good
hedging opportunity.

From a political perspective, this is most negative for Brazil and Mexico. Both countries hold elections in 2018, with the Mexican election further complicated by the ongoing NAFTA renegotiations.
We believe that the future of NAFTA hangs in the balance, with a high probability that the Trump
administration will decide to abrogate the deal.18
Currently, anti-market political forces are in the lead in both countries. In Brazil, no pro-market
candidate is leading in the polls (Chart 23). In fact, anti-market options have a 48% lead on the
centrists. Granted, there are ten months until the election, but we are skeptical that the Brazilian
population will change its mind and support reformers. If the median voter in Brazil supported
reforms, the current Temer administration would have passed them already.
In Mexico, anti-establishment candidate Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador (also known as AMLO) is
leading in the polls (Chart 24), as is his new party Morena (Chart 25). If Morena wins the most
seats in the Mexican Congress, it will be more difficult for the opposition parties to combine to
counter it.19

We do not
think the
EM rally is
sustainable
in 2018.

In 2017, we argued that politics were not a
tailwind for EM asset performance. Instead,
investors chased yield in the favorable economic context of Chinese economic stimulus,
low developed market yields, and a weak U.S.
dollar. In reality, politics was just as dire in
much of EM as it was in prior years of asset
underperformance, but the surge of global
liquidity in 2018 masked the problems.
We do not think the EM rally is sustainable in
2018. As the global economic and market context shifts, investors will start paying attention.
Suddenly, political problems will enter into
focus. Here we argue that Brazil and Mexico
are likely to be the main targets of portfolio
outflows, but a strong case could be made for
South Africa and Turkey as well.20

We Read (And Liked)  Inside Chinas Shadow Banking: The Next Subprime Crisis?
Just as black swans refer to low-probability, high-impact risks, gray rhinos, as defined by Michele Wucker,
refer to high-probability, high-impact risks. The idea of the gray rhinoceros went viral this summer after
Chinas Communist Party mouthpiece, The Peoples Daily, published an editorial in mid-July warning
that the countrys financial regulators needed to maintain a sense of urgency in combating financial
risks. They warned both against the black swan, but also against the gray rhinoceros, [as] all kinds
of risk signs cannot be taken lightly.
Chinas propaganda chiefs wrote this editorial the week after the National Financial Work Conference,
an important congregation of Chinas top financial authorities and other policymakers that occurs once
every five years and sets the trajectory for financial regulation and reforms. This years meeting made
the significant conclusion that Chinas various financial regulators needed to be better controlled by
the central bank, better coordinated amongst each other, and more effective in tackling the build-up of
systemic financial risks in the economy. It was the culmination of a wave of policy tightening that began
in October 2016 in the property sector, expanded in December 2016, and intensified in April with a
special Politburo meeting.
That gray rhinos are obvious entails that much has been written about them already. This is certainly
true of Chinese financial risks. So to get a better understanding of Chinas attempt to tackle its financial
gray rhinos, we thought we would turn to an earlier account of the problem: Joe Zhangs Inside Chinas
Shadow Banking: The Next Subprime Crisis?1 Despite the alarmist title, this short book is insightful, not
over-argued, and provides a useful primer in shadow banking and a helpful benchmark given the explosive
growth in the sector both before and after the books publication in 2014.
Joe Zhang is a corporate exec and editorialist with a background in prominent investment banks and
an early stint in Chinas central bank. The book is more engaging than one might expect of an extended
analysis of Chinas shadow sector because it mixes this analysis with Zhangs personal memoir about his
venture as chairman of Wansui Micro Credit in Guangzhou from 2011-12.
Zhangs style is admirably frank. Responding to criticisms that microcredit should focus on alleviating
poverty rather than making profits, he responds, Microcredit is just a business, like any other business.
Does it hurt the poor? I dont know. But an equally funny question is, does a department store make
consumers poorer?
His candor is especially an asset when it comes to dealing with the realities (I should say disappointments) of Chinas centrally planned economy and constant promises of deeper market-oriented reform.
Speaking to a group of college graduates, Zhang warns, in the 1980s, the government made us believe
that liberalization of interest rates and, indeed, the Renminbi was only 5 years away. Those five years
have never ended. The five-year targets have become constant rolling targets.
The book does not really answer the question in the subtitle, whether China faces a subprime crisis. Instead it argues that the real dangers lie in the countrys ballooning corporate leverage, within the property
sector and local governments, and that shadow banking compounds these risks because developers and
local government financing vehicles are the biggest users of it.
The gist of the argument is structural and as relevant today as in the heady days of the credit splurge
when Zhang ran his microcredit firm: shadow banking is a symptom, not a cause, of Chinas financial

disease. Financial repression is the cause. Nominal wage growth is much higher than underlying labor
productivity. Excessive state control of interest rates entails the suppression of deposit rates beneath the
long-term inflation rate. Negative real rates drive savers into the property market and alternative investments. State control of lending rates prevents small, risky and private firms from accessing credit. The
shadow sector thus emerges to mediate between the vast savings looking to escape inflation and these
underprivileged firms.
As a result, a dual credit market has emerged, one for formal and privileged borrowers, the other for
informal underdog borrowers. A war between regulators and financial innovators has also emerged, with
regulators often thwarting themselves because of overlapping and inefficient bureaucracy, while also
squelching small business growth and innovation.
The solution, if the government wishes to support SMEs, savers, and disadvantaged borrowers (i.e. all
those who suffer from excessive money and credit because they lack real assets that are appreciating
with inflation) is for the Peoples Bank of China to embark on a genuine rate hike cycle, reining in money
growth, dis-inflating the economy and cutting back on the waste of resources. Unfortunately, Zhang
admits, rising unemployment rates will be a by-product.
Theres the rub. China needs to tighten policy without inducing a recession and wave of unemployment
that would jeopardize stability and Communist Party supremacy.
This is where Zhangs book becomes relevant to today, a time when the central bank and financial regulators are addressing the very lack of coordination that Zhang identifies, and are preparing to upgrade their
coordinated campaign against excessive liquidity, leverage, and financial innovation. The centralizing and
pro-state aspect of this campaign is undoubtedly repugnant to Zhang, even as the gradual liberalization
of interest rates and tightening of monetary conditions is necessary in his view.
The critical question lies in the states tolerance for pain. Has anything changed? One of Zhangs key
assumptions is that Chinas collective leadership model is inherently risk averse. No one great man or
great entity can force the necessary changes. It will require national consensus. After Xi Jinpings extraordinary consolidation of power since 2012, however, this model has evolved. If it is true, as Xi and
his top economic planners have acknowledged, that Chinas financial stability is a national systemic risk,
then it cannot be assumed that Chinas talk of financial tightening, this time around, is merely talk.
Either way, Zhang should get the credit both for spotting the gray rhino early on and describing it clearly
and accurately for those of us trying to understand the ramifications of the states attempt to regulate
and regularize it in 2018. He runs the gamut of the formal and informal financial sector, explaining the
mechanics of non-bank entities, like pawnshop lenders, microcredit firms, trust companies, and guarantee
companies, and their relations with local governments and larger state-owned commercial banks. And
while he cannot avoid the alphabet soup of Chinese finance  AMCs, P2P lenders, IPOs, WMPs, etc  in
each instance he clarifies rather than obscures the inner workings of the system.

THREE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS FOR DECEMBER:
DEC 8, 12,

U.S. BUDGET, DEBT CEILING, AND SPECIAL ELECTION

The Republicans are in the process of negotiating a joint tax bill between the two legislative houses even as they seek a continuing resolution to
fund the government in lieu of 2018 fiscal appropriations. The debt ceiling is unlikely to be breached because neither party could withstand the
public backlash if the federal government failed to deliver on social payments. But a partial government shutdown could ensue, particularly if the
Democrats insist on resolving the status of Dreamers, illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, ahead of the March 2018 deadline
that Trump has given Congress on the matter. Meanwhile, the Alabama special election on Dec. 12 could see the Republican majority in the Senate
reduced to a single seat if scandal-tainted Roy Moore loses to Democratic challenger Doug Jones. A GOP loss could jeopardize the tax bill if it has
not passed by Jan. 3, 2018.
DEC 12, 2017

U.S., IRAN, ISRAEL

CONGRESS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO REIMPOSE IRAN SANCTIONS

President Trump on Oct 13 decertified Irans full implementation of the 2015 nuclear agreement under the U.S.s Iran Nuclear Agreement Review
Act. This gave Congress 60 days to determine whether to impose new sanctions. Congress may demur from new sanctions. The bigger question
is whether Trump will use unilateral executive action to scrap the agreement, which would significantly increase geopolitical risks in the Middle
East. Trump could also shift the U.S.-recognized capital of Israel to Jerusalem on Dec. 11, setting off a firestorm in the Muslim world.
DEC 2017

CENTRAL ECONOMIC WORK CONFERENCE

The annual economic meeting sets targets and policies for the year ahead. This is the first such meeting after President Xi Jinpings consolidation
of power and reaffirmation of his reform agenda at the 19th National Party Congress. The question is not whether the GDP growth target will be
lower, but whether there will be one at all. Also, will credit and monetary policies tighten up? Finally, will any leaks about other reform priorities
for 2018 trickle out of the meeting -- such as financial regulation, property curbs, local government debt controls, SOE restructuring, or a new raft
of overcapacity cuts?

IMPORTANCE

Italian elections are the highest probability risk to European integration at the moment. Italian opinion polling reveals that Italians are the most
skeptical of the euro, and most optimistic about life outside the EU, than any EU member other than the U.K., which of course is leaving the common market. Moreover, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement is neck-in-neck with the ruling Democratic Party, though it has moderated
somewhat on euro membership. We do not think Italy will ultimately leave, but the elections will have a messy result. Eventually a market riot may
be necessary to snap Italy back into the union.

The Mexican election in 2018 will be a watershed moment. The top two candidates are the former wife of ex-President Felipe Calderon, Margarita
Zavala, and the left-wing firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, better known by his acronym AMLO. A return of the center-right PAN to power,
which Zavala represents, would be market-positive. However, we do not think that AMLO would necessarily be a negative. While he is riding the
wave of anti-Trump sentiment, Obrador lacks support in the legislature for any truly dramatic policy changes. The question for investors, however,
is whether PAN can get enough seats in congress to effect and implement pro-market reforms.

BREXIT TALKS TO CONCLUDE (TENTATIVE DEADLINE)

Venezuela has descended into chaos since the death of strongman Hugo Chavez and the oil price slump of 2014. The socialist, military-backed
regime has deprived the legislature of its authority since the sweeping opposition victory in 2015. The timing of the election lies in question. Oil
production is likely to continue slipping while domestic unrest will continue to escalate.

GENERAL ELECTION

Brazil has witnessed the worst recession in a century and the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Now her successor, interim President
Michel Temer of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, is engulfed in corruption allegations and political recriminations. This election could
potentially recapitalize the political system, enabling badly needed structural reform, or it could see the country go further down the road of economic populism.

MIDTERM ELECTION

A major test for the Trump administration and congressional Republican majorities, given the problems of scandal and policy misfires. The Senate
is set to favor Republicans in this election cycle, and Democrats in Trumps blue swing states are up for re-election, so Democratic strategy, the
youth vote, and the staying power of Trumps electoral base will be put to the test.
